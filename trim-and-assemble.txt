RESULTS:

All statistics are based on contigs of size >= 500 bp, unless otherwise noted (e.g., "# contigs (>= 0 bp)" and "Total length (>= 0 bp)" include
all contigs).

CONCLUSIONS AND INTERPRETATION:

Trimming removed 461 reads from R1 and 3712 reads from R2, for a total of 4173 removed reads.
It appears that trimming the reads produced the same number of contigs within the same size-bins.
Both the N50 and L50 also appear unchanged.
However, the total length decreased by 192 bp. Considering that over 4000 reads were removed,
it appears that the removed reads had little impact on the overall alignment.
Therefore, it can be concluded that our trimming was effective at removing reads that did not
contribute to the assembly of the genome.
