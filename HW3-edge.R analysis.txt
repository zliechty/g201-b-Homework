#The MDS plot with 10 samples shows a similar trend as the one with 6; the mutants cluster together on the
#right side, and the wt cluster on the other, though they are more broadly spread along the second axis.
#it appears that the separation on the second axis is due to which biological replication the sample comes
#from. The samples I added in were from the same sequencing lane, but different biological replicates, so

#that we could see the effect of biological variation on our gene expression.
#as far as the numbers of differentially expressed genes, using a FDR cutoff of 0.05, I found 4030 in the
#sample with 6 replicates, and 2940 in the samples with 10 replicates. This makes sense to me, because adding
#in a biological replicate would increase the amount of variation within each treatment, and an increased
#variation means less statistical certainty in calling differences.

#it appears looking only at the upregulated genes, 559/2940 are up regulated in the 10 rep analysis, whereas
# 3470/4030 are upregulated in the 6 rep analysis. Since that is a much smaller fraction, it appears that
#a lot of the lost differentially expressed genes are ones marked as upregulated in the 6 rep analysis.

#using a website venn-diagram tool (http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/) I was able to see how many genes
#overlapped between these two groups. Of all differentially expressed genes at an FDR of 0.05, 1327 were
#unique to the 6 rep analysis, 237 were unique to the 10 rep analysis, and 2703 were shared between both
#of them. This means that in total, 1327 genes were lost by adding the reps, and 237 genes were gained
#by adding the extra reps.
